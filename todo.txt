- standardize editing commands, they should all take and return an editor_buffer_t
    - insert
    - append (convenience for 'insert at end')
    - delete
    - undo/redo
    - get text within a region (between two char #s or line:col - line:col)

- support UTF-16
    - Use BOM if applicable to determine file encoding (and, of course, byte order)

- use a slab allocator for all rope_t allocations
    - or, maybe find a way to use something like jon blow's 'temporary allocator' (keep a temp buffer in a context for example)
